# ✅ Success! Minimal Version Works!

## 🎉 **Great News:**
Your React Native setup is **perfect**! The issue was with navigation/screens, not React Native itself.

---

## 📋 **Next Steps (One at a Time):**

### **✅ Step 1: DONE** 
- Minimal App.js works ✓

### **🔄 Step 2: Test NavigationContainer** (Current)
I've updated App.js to test NavigationContainer with a simple screen.

**Test this:**
```bash
npm start -- --reset-cache
npm run android
```

**Expected:** Should show "✅ NavigationContainer Works!"

### **Step 3: Add SignInScreen** (After Step 2 works)
Once NavigationContainer works, we'll add SignInScreen.

### **Step 4: Add IntroScreen** (After Step 3 works)
Then add IntroScreen.

### **Step 5: Add SignUpScreen** (After Step 4 works)
Finally add SignUpScreen.
